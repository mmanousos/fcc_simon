freeCodeCamp project: [build a Simon game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-simon-game)

### Design
For the curved buttons on the game console, I used the guidelines for creating a quarter of a ring found on StackOverflow: [Quarter of a Ring](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16263358/quarter-of-a-ring-with-css-and-html#16263646)

### Scripting

After my challenges with the Tic Tac Toe project, I attempted to use Test Driven Design for this project.

I implemented the [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com) testing framework.
