freeCodeCamp project: [build a Simon game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-simon-game)

### Design
For the curved buttons on the game console, I used the guidelines for creating a quarter of a ring found on StackOverflow: [Quarter of a Ring](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16263358/quarter-of-a-ring-with-css-and-html#16263646)

### Scripting

After my challenges with the Tic Tac Toe project, I attempted to use Test Driven Design for this project.

I implemented the [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com) testing framework.

Unfortunately, trying to implement tests for the scripting proved unsuccessful. I believe I need to seek further guidance and do some more research on this topic before trying again.

### Git / GitHub

I successfully used branches for this project. I did have some issues with merging my final branch back into master to complete the project but was able to find some guidance on StackOverflow: [Replacing Master Branch in Git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2862590/how-to-replace-master-branch-in-git-entirely-from-another-branch).

Additionally, a friend introduced me to the [-stash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash) command which seems very helpful for pausing work on a particular issue to address something else.
